# WSJF

Task Scheduler is a simple app designed to help you manage your ongoing tasks and flow of work, using a prioritisation technique known as WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First).

The calculation involves measures for User Value, Time Value, Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement Value, and Job Size. Jobs that can deliver the most value, and are of the shortest duration are selected first for implementation.

The app has been in development for around a month and is far from perfect, but it will evolve and improve over time.
